# Step 1: Install Dnsmasq on Ubuntu 22.04|20.04|18.04
sudo systemctl disable systemd-resolved
sudo systemctl stop systemd-resolved

# Remove the symlinked resolv.conf file
ls -lh /etc/resolv.conf
sudo unlink /etc/resolv.conf

# Then create new resolv.conf file.
echo nameserver 8.8.8.8 | sudo tee /etc/resolv.conf

# Dnsmasq is available on the apt repository, easy installation can be done by running:
